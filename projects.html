            Visual Odometry on NVIDIA-Jetson ORIN Nano Board Using Stereo Camera Input (DST Sponsored IIT-Delhi Intership Project).</h2>
          <p>The project utilizes ORB SLAM with a stereo camera on the NVIDIA Jetson ORIN Nano Board for real-time Visual Odometry. This implementation estimates the camera's pose as well as creates a map
            according to the key points detected by the camera. This system is suitable for applications like tour guide, navigation and augmented reality on an embedded platform.</p><br>

          <h2> Fog Removal In Images Using RESNET and Weighted Loss Combination</h2>
          <p>In this project, we tackle the challenge of foggy image restoration by employing a deep learning approach with the RESNET architecture, utilizing 8 blocks for enhanced performance. Additionally, we implement a weighted loss combination technique to optimize fog removal and preserve image details and colors. Through extensive experiments on various foggy datasets, our approach demonstrates superior results compared to traditional methods. This research has significant implications for computer vision applications, such as autonomous driving, surveillance, and medical imaging, where clear and accurate visual information is crucial for decision-making and analysis.</p><br>

          <h2> Nighttime Flare Removal in Images</h2>
          <p>In this project, we propose DeFlare-Net to detect, and remove flares. Typically, flares in hand-held devices are inherent due to internal reflection of light and forward scattering of lens material. The distortions due to flares limit the applications in the field of computer vision. Research challenges towards detection and removal of flare persist due to multiple occurrences of flare across intensities. The performance of existing flare removal frameworks are sensitive to the assumption of underlying physics and geometry, leading to artefacts in the deflared image. The recent methods eliminate light source implicitly whilst removal of flare from the image leading to loss of information. Towards this, we propose DeFlare-Net for detection, and removal of flares.</p><br>
