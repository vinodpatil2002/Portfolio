          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>Greetings, I am Vinod Patil, a passionate Electronics and Communication Engineering student at KLE Technological University. My core interests revolve around computer vision, graphics, machine learning, and Python development. I have successfully completed projects like flare removal in nighttime conditions, fog removal, and low-light image and video enhancement in the realm of computer vision.</p>
        <br>
           <p> Notably, I secured the 9th and 14th positions worldwide in the MIPI challenge 2023 for nighttime flare removal. My skillset encompasses Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Docker, and Linux. My engineering background has honed my problem-solving abilities, and I apply a critical and analytical mindset to my work in computer vision and machine learning.</p>
        <br>    
            <p>I am driven by the desire to solve real-world challenges, particularly in healthcare and sustainability domains. My enthusiasm for continuous learning keeps me abreast of the latest trends in computer vision and machine learning.</p>
         <br>   
            <p>I am seeking opportunities as a research assistant or computer vision engineer to contribute my skills and experiences to demanding projects. My dedication, strong work ethic, and passion for computer vision make me an ideal team member for your organization. I would be thrilled to explore potential roles and discuss how I can add value to your team's objectives. Please feel free to connect with me to initiate a conversation about potential collaborations.</p>
